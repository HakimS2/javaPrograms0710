Hello Guys, Welcome to my channel H Y R Tutorials. in this video, we will

discuss about XPath Axes. what is
meant by axes. The axes is nothing

but a relationship between your
current element to the target element.

so in web applications if you want to
find out an element, we have so many

controls and here we are talking about
the XPath right... so the XPath is

basically used for finding control if it
is not having a unique identification

parameter. let's say like ID, name or
something... so if the element is not

having a unique parameter then we will
go for XPath or CssSelector. so in our

earlier videos we have seen how we can
write an XPath if it is having attribute

values. let's say even though it is not
having unique attributes like ID is not

there maybe the name is there but it is
not unique and class name is there it is

also not unique so we can mix those two
things and we can write the XPath and

make the element as unique. if it is not
sufficient you can use other attributes

and mix with this one and we can write a
unique XPath right..
